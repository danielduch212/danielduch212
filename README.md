<p><u>.NET Developer</u> - interested in this technology since studying at the <u>Silesian University of Technology.</u></p>

In the past, I worked on desktop apps using WinForms and WPF - sample projects are down below.

Currently, I build projects using <u>Blazor technology - both WASM and Blazor Server</u>.

**It is an API for car repair workshops.**  
This API is written in ASP.NET 8 with Entity Framework to build the database and other useful packages.  
It is built using the Clean Code Pattern and CQRS.  
The application is adjusted to work with Azure Web Services + SQL Database.  
It uses Blob Storage and has functions to manage access to it.  
Basic CI/CD is used.
